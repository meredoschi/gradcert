## HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

Back in 2013, I first started writing what would then become **grad**uate **cert**ificate.

It originated as a personal project and steadily grew.  As I learned more about Ruby on Rails, I later wrote some Rspec tests and began to use linters to beautify the code, when feasible.

*This is its first public/international release (still on the development branch).  As such, it may contain some rough edges.*

Its production version (which contains additional code) has been running since April 2016 with generally positive feedback from users.

## ABOUT

In essence, the application's goal is to enable business/education managers to easily track post-graduate scholarship program recipients.

By design decision, it also allows participating institutions to view and enter data related to their own students, using a responsive user interface.  Theoretically, it should work with various browsers and mobile devices.

## TO-DOS

In a future version, I plan on translating the slides (pdf document) to English and to fill in some missing i18n (activerecord model) attributes as well.

## RUBY VERSION

2.3.5 (rvm)

Developed on both Linux and Mac environments.

## DATABASE

Postgres 9.6.6
